errorTemplate = Could not connect to the database. Please check your JDBC connection URL, or the connectivity to the database.
shortDescription = The node failed to connect to the database on node startup and thus prevented the node from starting correctly.
actionsToFix = This happened either because the database connection was misconfigured or because the database was unreachable. Check that the JDBC URL is configured correctly in your 'node.conf' file. If this is correctly configured, then check your database connection.
